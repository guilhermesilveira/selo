# Changelog

All notable changes to `@guilhermesilveira/selo` are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — pre-1.0 the contract is allowed to break in `MINOR` bumps.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Verdict, count rules** — count rules now ratchet on `violationsVsGoal` (the violations cap) rather than on the per-unit `value`, which was always 1 and made the ratchet meaningless. `migrateBaseline()` snaps stale baselines (`current < violationsVsGoal`) up to the new format on first run, persisted. Closes [#2](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo/issues/2). ([60f4614](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo/commit/60f4614))
- **Verdict, arrived state** — once `current ≤ goal`, regressions return to goal immediately with no step-tightening regardless of overshoot magnitude. `current` is now clamped at `goal` from below at seed and bless time — historical lows aren't promoted to a contract. ([981dd28](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo/commit/981dd28))

### Fixed

- **`selo check` improved-branch message** — `prev` was captured *after* the baseline write, so the message always read `worst N→N`. Now captured before. ([60f4614](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo/commit/60f4614))

### Added

- **Parent links on parsed AST** — `parseFile` walks the AST after parsing and attaches `parent` references. Rule packs that need to walk up the tree (e.g. to find a function's enclosing class or extract a name from a `VariableDeclarator`) get them for free.

## [0.0.1] — Initial release

- Linter engine: file walker (`globby` + `.gitignore`), parser (`@typescript-eslint/parser`), `runRule`, seal-message renderer, project bootstrap.
- Ratchet machinery: pure step math, `selo.baseline.json` I/O, verdict algorithm (seeded / arrived / arrivedFailed / flat / improved / regressed).
- Config loader for `selo.config.{mjs,js,ts,json}`.
- CLI commands: `selo check`, `selo bless-current`, `selo get-maxes`, `selo histogram`.
- Public exports for rule-pack authors via the `SeloRule` / `SeloMeasurement` / `SeloFile` / `SeloRulePack` contract.
