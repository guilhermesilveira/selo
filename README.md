# selo

> _selo de qualidade guilherme raiz_ — a small linter built around a goal-driven, deterministic ratchet. Rules return per-unit measurements; the engine handles ratcheting toward a goal you set.

This README is **agent-first**. Read top to bottom.

---

## Human explanation

**Continuous improvement, never regression.** You set a quality goal you don't yet meet — say, "no function over 80 lines" — and start moving toward it without breaking the build today. selo measures your codebase as it is and seeds a baseline. From then on each commit either holds the line, improves it (the baseline auto-tightens to lock the gain in), or makes things worse. Regressions fail. Baseline writes also exit non-zero so the generated `selo.baseline.json` diff is noticed, reviewed, and committed. When you do force a regression, the rule responds by tightening the active threshold one step closer to the goal. The migration is monotonic: the codebase can never get further from the goal than its committed baseline, and the build verdict is a pure function of code + baseline files — no clock, no git history, no surprise reruns.

**A small linter, not yet another ESLint plugin.** selo is its own linter. Rules implement a contract that returns per-unit measurements directly — `{value, file, startLine, name, data}` — so the engine never has to reconstruct numeric values from rendered messages. That keeps the ratchet deterministic, the histogram universal, and the seal-message rendering owned by the engine. Rules ship as **packs**, listed below.

---

## Rule packs

selo on its own does nothing — it loads rule packs. The two officially-maintained packs:

| Pack | Repo | npm | Ships |
|---|---|---|---|
| **selo-solid** | [github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo-solid](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo-solid) | `selo-solid` | 8 SOLID-alike rules native to selo (`srp/max-file-lines`, `srp/max-function-lines`, `srp/max-params`, `srp/max-depth`, `srp/max-statements-per-function`, `srp/max-cyclomatic-complexity`, `srp/max-class-methods`, `ocp/no-type-discriminating-switch`). Start here. |
| **selo-eslint-raiz** | [github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo-eslint-raiz](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo-eslint-raiz) | `selo-eslint-raiz` | Three core ESLint rules wrapped (`no-empty`, `no-useless-catch`, `object-curly-newline`-imports), plus a generic `shimEslintRule()` helper for porting any other ESLint rule into the contract. A demo of the shim pattern as much as a useful pack. |

Writing your own pack is straightforward — see [Rule contract](#the-rule-contract) below.

## Agent: help me install this

Runbook for installing selo into a user's project. Each step's outcome is verifiable.

### 1. Install the engine + rule packs

```sh
npm install --save-dev @guilhermesilveira/selo selo-solid
```

(Use `selo-eslint-raiz` too if you want shimmed ESLint built-ins.)

### 2. Write `selo.config.mjs` at the project root

```js
import solid from 'selo-solid';

export default {
  packs: [solid],
  rules: {
    'srp/max-function-lines':         { goal: 80 },
    'srp/max-cyclomatic-complexity':  { goal: 15 },
    'srp/max-class-methods':          { goal: 10 },
    'srp/max-statements-per-function':{ goal: 30 },
    'ocp/no-type-discriminating-switch': { exempt: [] },
  },
};
```

### 3. Seed the baseline

```sh
npx selo check
```

First run writes `selo.baseline.json` with today's worst per rule and exits non-zero to make the new baseline visible (`seeded ...`). Commit that file. Re-running `selo check` should print `flat` for every rule and exit 0.

### 4. Wire pre-commit + CI

Add `npx selo check` to whatever pre-commit hook the project already has. For read-only CI, use `npx selo check --dont-bless-baseline`; for CI that is allowed to fail when the baseline should be committed, use plain `npx selo check`.

### 5. (If OCP fires on legacy code) exempt those files

Add their relative paths to the `exempt` array in `selo.config.mjs`, re-run `selo check`. Refactor and remove from the list in follow-up commits.

### 6. Commit

```
selo.config.mjs
selo.baseline.json
package.json + package-lock.json
```

The codebase is now under selo.

## The rule contract

A rule pack exports a `SeloRulePack`. Each rule in the pack implements:

```ts
interface SeloRule<Options = unknown> {
  meta: {
    id: string;                 // 'srp/max-function-lines'
    description: string;
    type: 'threshold' | 'count';
    unitLabel: string;          // 'lines/fn', 'methods', 'todos'
    seal: string;               // message template, supports {{placeholders}}
    defaults?: Options;
  };
  measure(file: SeloFile, options: Options): SeloMeasurement[];
}

interface SeloMeasurement {
  value: number;                // threshold: the value; count: 1
  file: string;
  startLine?: number;
  endLine?: number;
  name?: string;
  data?: Record<string, string | number>;
}

interface SeloFile {
  path: string;                 // project-relative
  source: string;
  ast: unknown;                 // @typescript-eslint/parser AST
}
```

`type: 'threshold'` rules report a numeric value per unit; the engine computes `worst` and `violationsVsGoal = count(value > goal)`. Histogram is meaningful.

`type: 'count'` rules report once per violation, always with `value: 1`. `worst` is meaningless; `violationsVsGoal` is the violation count.

The `seal` string is a message template with `{{key}}` placeholders filled in from each measurement's `data` at render time. The rule never talks to the developer directly — the engine renders.

---

## CLI

All commands accept `--cwd <dir>`; default is `process.cwd()`.

### `selo check [--dont-bless-baseline]`

The verifier. Run in pre-commit and CI.

- Reads `selo.config.{mjs,js,ts,json}` and `selo.baseline.json`.
- For each ruleable rule (one with a `goal`): measure, compare, apply the verdict.
- Seeds on first run for any rule missing from baseline.
- Auto-updates baseline downward on improvement, including `current`, so `selo get-maxes` sees the tighter cap.
- **Exits 1 on regression or when it writes the baseline.** If the only issue is a baseline write, review and commit `selo.baseline.json`, then rerun.
- `--dont-bless-baseline` makes the command read-only: it reports seeds/improvements/regressions but does not write `selo.baseline.json`.

### `selo bless-current`

Records today's measurements as the new baseline `current` / `worst` / `violationsVsGoal`.

- **Never worsens.** If a rule's measurement would make the baseline worse, that rule is silently skipped — no error, no failure, no write.
- Goal is never touched.

### `selo get-maxes`

Emits a JSON object of `{ruleId: current}` from `selo.baseline.json`, filtered to rules in `selo.config`. Useful for syncing external lint configs (e.g. an ESLint rule's `max` option) against the seeded current.

### `selo histogram <rule-id>`

Distribution of a threshold rule. Buckets every measured unit relative to the cap (current or goal). Lets you see *shape* — long tail, bulk, regression direction. The bucket just past the cap is usually the cheapest set of wins.

Count rules don't have meaningful histograms, so the command refuses for them.

---

## Configuration

`selo.config.{mjs,js,ts,json}`:

```ts
interface SeloConfig {
  packs: SeloRulePack[];
  rules: Record<string, RuleConfig>;
  files?: string[];     // default ['**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}']
  ignore?: string[];    // added to built-in defaults (node_modules, dist, ...)
}

interface RuleConfig {
  goal?: number;        // required for threshold rules
  step?: number;        // default 0.01
  exempt?: string[];    // project-relative paths to skip
  options?: unknown;    // rule-specific
}
```

`selo.baseline.json` (CLI-managed):

```json
{
  "srp/max-function-lines": {
    "current": 904,
    "worst": 904,
    "violationsVsGoal": 297
  }
}
```

---

## Verdict algorithm

```
measure → (nowWorst, nowViolations)

if no baseline entry → SEED: write {current: nowWorst, worst, violationsVsGoal}; exit 1 so the file is committed

if stored.current <= goal → "arrived"
    fail iff any unit > current

else (still ratcheting):
    if nowWorst > stored.worst OR nowViolations > stored.violationsVsGoal
        newCurrent = current - max(1, ceil(step * (current - goal)))   // clamped to goal
        FAIL with: "tighten current to newCurrent, fix N units, then run `selo check`"
    elif nowWorst < stored.worst OR nowViolations < stored.violationsVsGoal
        improved → update current/worst/violationsVsGoal downward; exit 1 so the file is committed
    else
        flat → exit 0
```

Pure function of (code + committed baseline). No clock, no git history. Same input → same verdict, always.

## Releasing

Manual SemVer release flow. While we're pre-1.0, `MINOR` bumps may introduce breaking changes (per the SemVer 0.x carve-out); track them in `CHANGELOG.md`.

```sh
# 1. Move the [Unreleased] block in CHANGELOG.md under a new
#    `## [<version>] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading.
# 2. Bump the version + commit + tag in one shot:
npm version patch     # 0.0.1 → 0.0.2 (fix-level)
# or  npm version minor   # 0.0.1 → 0.1.0 (feature, possible breaking pre-1.0)

# 3. Push the commit and the tag together:
git push --follow-tags

# 4. Publish (one-time `npm login` first; scoped packages need --access public):
npm publish --access public
```

The `prepublishOnly` script enforces `npm run build && npm test && npm run lint` before any publish, so a broken state can't ship.

### Engine releases first

`selo` is the upstream of the rule contract. When you change anything in `src/contract/index.ts`, in the verdict algorithm, or in the CLI's input/output shape:

1. Release the engine bump from this repo first.
2. In each rule pack ([selo-solid](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo-solid), [selo-eslint-raiz](https://github.com/guilhermesilveira/selo-eslint-raiz)), update the `peerDependencies."@guilhermesilveira/selo"` range to require the new version, run the test suite against it, and release the pack.

This ordering means a pack on npm always works against at least one published engine version.

---

## Determinism contract

The verdict of `selo check` is a pure function of (a) the source code currently on disk and (b) the committed `selo.baseline.json` and `selo.config.*`. No clock, no git history, no environment variables, no random seeds.

Every counter / threshold / accepted-state advance lives inside the committed JSON files and is advanced only by an explicit action (`selo bless-current` or default `selo check` blessing). Use `selo check --dont-bless-baseline` when a CI job must be strictly read-only.

If you find yourself wanting `Date.now()`, a SHA, a merge-base diff, or anything that varies between runs at the same code state — stop. The mechanism you want should advance the JSON state instead.
